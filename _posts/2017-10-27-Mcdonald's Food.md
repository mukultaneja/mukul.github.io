#### Context:
Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald’s but for themselves, together with McDonald’s. Many of McDonald’s most famous menu items – like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin – were created by franchisees.

#### Content:
This dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.

#### Acknowledgements:
The menu items and nutrition facts were scraped from the McDonald's website.

#### Inspiration:
How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain? How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake? Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value? What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs? What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?
